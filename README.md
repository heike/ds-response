## Issues
- Focus should be on creating useable tools along with data science education:
    - Jenny Bryan
    - Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel
    - Max Kune (CARAT package)
    - RStudio

- Data science is a backlash from mainstream theoretical statistics
    - Tukey started in mainstream theoretical statistics, but as he became more interested in data analysis, he moved to the "fringe"
    - This is almost like physics vs. engineering - engineering is applied physics, and physicists focus on proofs and theories, where engineers learn the basics and apply physics to build things. Data science is in many ways data engineering - building useful things using data and/or with data.
    
- 6 divisions of data science should be 5 parts of data science with a parallel track which involves building tools for the practice of data science
    - tool building is critical for data science, but building tools for practicing data science is not itself the practice of data science...    
    Being a farmer : Designing the tractor :: Doing data science : building tools for data science
    - Building tools for data science is related data-meta-science: the science of how people conduct data science. 
    - Building tools seems to be (in practice) related to the teaching of data science. This is partially because you end up teaching people how to use your tools, but it's also because the people teaching data science seem to want to make the tough things easier.
    
- Issues with prediction as an end goal:
    1. Risk assessment - when does the model fail?
    2. Defensability - how to explain the model to a manager?
    
    - This may be at least part of why statisticians are so uncomfortable with machine learning techniques that don't explicitly model error distributions. It's worth acknowledging that they may have a point.
